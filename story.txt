Once upon a time, a tiny cloud named Nimo floated gently above a peaceful village. Nimo loved watching the children play, the birds fly, and the flowers sway in the wind. But Nimo had one dream — to see the ocean.

One morning, the wind whispered, “It’s time.” Nimo was nervous but excited. The wind carried him over hills, forests, and cities. Along the way, Nimo grew bigger and heavier with water.

Finally, after days of travel, Nimo saw it — the vast, sparkling ocean. Overwhelmed with joy, he let out all his water as rain, creating ripples on the sea and a beautiful rainbow in the sky.

Nimo smiled. He had followed his dream, and in doing so, became part of something beautiful.
